Last year was weird, lot of great things happenned on my life, while in the end of October I was laid off.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t came here to talk about the past but the future. This year of 2024 I will with complete my personal goals and my carrer ones.
About my carrer, I want to write an interpreter, a compiler, get more into this world of distributed systems, and this year I want to understand what I really like in tech, at least for now.</description></item><item><title>whoami</title><link>https://1garo.github.io/posts/whoami/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 18:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://1garo.github.io/posts/whoami/</guid><description>One of my 2023 new year&amp;rsquo;s wishes was to write a blog post each month, but as you can see it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.
