Lately I have been studying cryptography and one of it&amp;rsquo;s foundations are Caesar's cipher.
Introduction to Caesar&amp;rsquo;s cipher The idea is that you have a shift from 0 to 25, who as the name suggest, shift each letter it&amp;rsquo;s value, for example, a shift of 3 would output something like:
Plaintext: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD So it means that to communicate using this cipher, you would receive the message and the shift used to encrypt, so you can decrypt the message.</description></item><item><title>Why you should use zod as your validator?</title><link>https://1garo.github.io/posts/why-you-should-use-zod/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 16:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://1garo.github.io/posts/why-you-should-use-zod/</guid><description>Why you should use zod as your validator? The title is just to bring some attention&amp;hellip; I know, you use what you want, but today I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving some insights on zod, from someone that is using it daily for the last 6-8 months.
To keep it simple, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna omit most of the express app setup because it&amp;rsquo;s kinda easy to do, however you can find it in their documentation.</description></item></channel></rss>
