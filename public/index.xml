      <description>Why you should use zod as your validator? The title is just to bring some attention&amp;hellip; I know, you use what you want, but today I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving some insights on zod, from someone that is using it daily for the last 6-8 months.&#xA;To keep it simple, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna omit most of the express app setup because it&amp;rsquo;s kinda easy to do, however you can find it in their documentation.</description>

Sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t get what we want, right?! (me convincing myself of that).&#xA;But back to the idea of the post, who am I?&#xA;My name is Alexandre, online aka 1garo. I love games, visiting coffee shops with my girlfriend, making coffee and exercising (sometimes)&amp;hellip;&#xA;I spend most of my free time playing on PC, probably something on Steam (I love counter-strike),</description>
