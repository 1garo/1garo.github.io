My goal for this year is to have a post per day on this blog, I know that this means that not all of them will be able to be
really long and complex, but some of them will be more deep, don't worry. 

The goal here is build the discipline to write something
every single day, small or big, doesn't matter. But today is January 1st, so I will go back to my family, some pool time and *churrasco*.
