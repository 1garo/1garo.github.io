# 2024: Happy new year!

Last yearr was weird, lot of great things happenned on my life, while in the end of October I was laid off.

But I don't come here to talk about the past but the future. This year of 2024 I will with complete my personal goals and my carrer ones.

About my carrer, I want to **write an interpreter**, **a compiler**, get more into this world of distributed systems, and this year I want to
understand **what I really like in tech**, at least for now. Compilers, databases, work in a product like Sourcegraph would be really interesting.

I want to be more present here this year, share my thoughts and learning process, who knows I can help one of you guys.

**Happy new year!**
