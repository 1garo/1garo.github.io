One of my 2023 new year's wishes was to write a blog post each month, but as you can see it didn't happen.
Sometimes we don't get what we want, right?! (**me convincing myself of that**).

But back to the idea of the post, who am I?

My name is Alexandre, online aka *1garo*. I love games, visiting coffee shops with my girlfriend, making coffee and exercising (sometimes)...

I spend most of my free time playing on PC, probably something on Steam (I love counter-strike),

Most of my recent experience is dealing with `node` and `typescript`, but latelly I have been m messing round with `rust`, `interpreters` and `compilers`.

Now that you guys know who is behind the next wonderful texts, we can move on! Enjoy the ride!
