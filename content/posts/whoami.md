One of my 2023 new year's wish was to write a blog post for each month, as you can see it didn't happended,
sometimes we don't get what we want, right?! (**me convincing myself that**).

But back to the idea of the post, who am I?

My name is Alexandre, online aka *1garo*, and yes a **developer**,
but we'll talk about that on other posts, let's get back to non-sense.

I love games, visit coffee shops with my girlfriend, make coffee and to exercise (sometimes)...

Most of my gaming time is on PC so I am a fan of Steam,
with that said, I have more than 6k playing hours of **counter strike**,
yea I could be driving this thing below but I preferred to won some clutches.

Now to the boring things, I work with `node` and `typescript` (yea, send hugs pls) and in my free time love to mess
around with go and ðŸ¦€, lately really into `interpreters` and `compilers`.

Know that you guys know who is behind the next wonderful texts, we can move on, enjoy the ride.
