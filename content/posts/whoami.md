One of my 2023 new year's wishes was to write a blog post each month, but as you can see it didn't happen.
Sometimes we don't get what we want, right?! (**me convincing myself of that**).

But back to the idea of the post, who am I?

My name is Alexandre, online aka *1garo*, and yes a **developer**,
but we'll talk about that on other posts, let's get back to non-sense.

I love games, visiting coffee shops with my girlfriend, making coffee and exercising (sometimes)...

Most of my gaming time is on PC so I am a fan of Steam,
with that said, I have more than 6k playing hours of **counter strike**,
yea I could be driving this thing below but I preferred to won some clutches.

Now to the boring things: I work with `node` and `typescript` (yea, send hugs pls) and in my free time I love to mess
around with go and ðŸ¦€. Lately really into `interpreters` and `compilers`.

Now that you guys know who is behind the next wonderful texts, we can move on! Enjoy the ride!
